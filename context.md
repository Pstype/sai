# Short-Term Memory
- The IntelliSFX project has been reset to a clean, minimal Next.js application.
- All previous source code and build artifacts have been removed.
- Core configuration (`package.json`, `.env`, etc.) and dependencies (`node_modules`) are preserved.
- The current application is a simple "Welcome" page.
- The immediate next step is to re-scaffold the application based on the original plan.

# Long-Term Memory
- Core innovation: Layered audio generation, intelligent scene understanding, professional workflow integration, contextual synchronization.
- Architecture: Modular, event-driven Edge Functions for scalable, resilient processing. All AI model calls are abstracted and can be swapped/upgraded.
- Roadmap: 1) Supabase & frontend scaffolding, 2) Gemini integration, 3) Audio generation, 4) Timeline & merging, 5) Export & sharing.
- Best practices: Secure endpoints, RLS on Supabase, tests for core backend, App Router in Next.js, clear separation of concerns.
- UI/UX: "Instant First Draft, Infinite Refinements"â€”immediate results, transparent process, conversational and timeline-based editing, progressive disclosure, modern DAW-style timeline.

# Context Update Policy
- After any implementation or significant change, update this context.mdc file to keep the AI agent's personal context up-to-date and relevant for future decisions.
