Project Overview
IntelliSFX is an intelligent video-to-audio generation platform that leverages multiple AI models to automatically create layered, contextual soundtracks for video content. Unlike traditional single-model approaches, our system orchestrates three specialized AI models to produce professional-quality audio that truly matches the visual narrative.



Current solutions like ElevenLabs offer basic video-to-SFX https://videotosfx.elevenlabs.io/ generation but lack the sophistication for professional workflows and multi-layered audio composition. the leverage part is the 11labs seperate these features as a web app with open source code, if you need to check it out read @11labs.md

Our Solution
IntelliSFX uses a multi-model AI orchestration system that creates intelligent, layered audio compositions:
Core Innovation: Multi-Model Architecture

Gemini Vision: Advanced video analysis for scene understanding, emotion detection, and context mapping
Google Lyria (standard): Contextual music generation that matches scene mood and pacing
Meta AudioGen: Realistic sound effects generation synchronized to visual events

Key Differentiators

Layered Audio Generation: Produces ambient music + multiple SFX tracks that harmonize together
Intelligent Scene Understanding: Analyzes narrative context, not just visual objects
Professional Workflow Integration: Designed for actual production pipelines, not just hobbyist tools
Contextual Synchronization: Audio elements are timed and mixed based on video analysis insights



Technical Architecture
Frontend (Next.js)

User Interface: Intuitive drag-drop video upload with real-time processing visualization
Project Management: Dashboard for tracking processing status, managing assets, and organizing projects
Audio Editor: Timeline-based editor for fine-tuning generated audio layers
Export Tools: Multiple format support with stem separation capabilities

Backend (Supabase)

Database (Postgres): Project management, user authentication, asset tracking, and processing job queues.
Storage: Secure video upload and generated audio asset management.
Edge Functions: Serverless AI model orchestration and processing pipeline.
Real-time: Live status updates during multi-stage processing.

AI Processing Pipeline: The Asynchronous Assembly Line
Video Upload → Video Chunking → Parallel Chunk Analysis (Gemini) → Parallel Audio Generation (Lyria/AudioGen) → Timeline Assembly → Final Export

1.  **Video Upload & Chunking**: The video is broken into smaller, manageable chunks to handle processing constraints.
2.  **Parallel Analysis**: Each chunk is analyzed by Gemini Vision in parallel to extract scene context, mood, and events.
3.  **Parallel Audio Generation**: Based on the analysis, Lyria generates a cohesive music track while AudioGen creates batches of sound effects in parallel.
4.  **Timeline Assembly**: The system automatically synchronizes the generated music and SFX tracks with the video timeline, presenting a complete "Instant First Draft" to the user.
5.  **Interactive Refinement & Final Export**: The user refines the draft on the client-side, and the final high-quality render is handled by the backend.
