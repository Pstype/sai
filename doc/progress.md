## Refactoring Phase Completion (July 12, 2025)

### Overview
Completed foundational refactoring of the IntelliSFX project to address critical database, configuration, and type safety issues. This phase focused on creating a stable foundation for future development.

### Key Improvements
1. **Database Schema**:
   - Added `status` column to `audio_layers` table
   - Enforced foreign key constraints
   - Improved data integrity

2. **Configuration**:
   - Centralized environment handling in [`env.ts`](intellisfx/src/config/env.ts)
   - Removed scattered `process.env` references

3. **Type Safety**:
   - Created comprehensive [`supabase.ts`](intellisfx/src/types/supabase.ts) types
   - Enabled strict type checking across codebase

4. **API Routes**:
   - Updated routes to use new patterns
   - Added proper error handling
   - Skipped Lyria implementation as requested

### Verification
- Comprehensive verification report: [`changes/intellisfx_verification_report.md`](changes/intellisfx_verification_report.md)
- 95% of planned tasks completed
- Codebase stability significantly improved

### Next Steps
1. Complete remaining documentation tasks
2. Implement owner-based RLS policies
3. Begin frontend and core logic refactoring


### **Phase 2 Completion (July 12, 2025)**

### Overview
This phase successfully addressed all outstanding tasks from the initial refactoring, bringing the backend and database to a feature-complete state.

### Key Improvements
1. **Row-Level Security**:
   - Implemented full owner-based RLS policies for all relevant tables, ensuring users can only access their own data.

2. **API Route Standardization**:
   - Audited and refactored all API routes to use the standardized Supabase client, consistent error handling, and correct schema names.

3. **Documentation**:
   - Created `database_schema.md` with a complete Mermaid ER diagram and table descriptions.
   - Updated `.env.local.example` with all required environment variables.

### Verification
- All tasks from the previous phase are now marked as complete in the verification report.
- The system is stable and meets all backend requirements.

### Next Steps
- Proceed with frontend implementation and integration.

### **Frontend and Backend Integration (July 13, 2025)**

### Overview
This phase focused on connecting the frontend UI to the backend services, enabling a complete end-to-end user workflow. This included implementing a functional video uploader, connecting Zustand stores to the live Supabase backend, and creating a simulated processing pipeline to test real-time updates.

### Key Improvements
1. **Video Uploader**:
   - Implemented a drag-and-drop video uploader that securely uploads files to Supabase Storage using signed URLs.
   - Added real-time progress tracking and robust error handling.

2. **State Management**:
   - Replaced all mock data in Zustand stores (`projects.ts`, `processing.ts`) with live data fetched from the Supabase backend.
   - Implemented real-time updates using Supabase channels, ensuring the UI automatically reflects changes in the database.

3. **End-to-End Workflow**:
   - Created a simulated processing logic in the `on-video-upload` API route to test the entire workflow.
   - Verified that the frontend correctly reacts to backend changes in real-time, with processing status and progress bars updating automatically.

### Verification
- The user can now upload a video, see it appear in their project list, and watch the processing status update in real-time without any manual intervention.
- The integration successfully demonstrates the complete end-to-end user experience as planned.

### **Upload Workflow Refactoring (July 13, 2025)**

### Overview
This refactoring addressed a critical race condition in the video upload process. The workflow was re-architected to correctly implement a two-step signed URL upload, ensuring the backend only begins processing after the file is successfully stored.

### Key Improvements
1.  **Correct Orchestration**: The frontend now correctly orchestrates the upload process, first requesting a signed URL, then uploading the file, and finally notifying the backend.
2.  **API Route Separation**: The API routes were separated to handle distinct responsibilities: `/api/upload-url` for providing the signed URL and `/api/on-video-upload` for receiving the completion notification.
3.  **Robustness**: The new workflow is more robust and reliable, eliminating the race condition and ensuring that the backend never attempts to process a file that doesn't exist.

### **Real-time Feedback Loop Refactoring (July 13, 2025)**

### Overview
This definitive refactoring addressed a subtle race condition in the real-time feedback loop that occurred after a video upload. The changes ensure that the user receives immediate and reliable feedback on the processing status of their project.

### Key Improvements
1.  **Proactive Real-time Subscription**: The frontend now subscribes to project updates *before* the upload begins, ensuring no events are missed.
2.  **Persistent Real-time Channel**: The Zustand store now manages a single, persistent real-time channel, improving performance and reliability.
3.  **Immediate UI Feedback**: The UI now provides optimistic feedback to the user, creating a more responsive and seamless experience.

### Next Steps
- Begin implementation of the core AI services for video analysis and audio generation.
### **Video Uploader TypeScript Fixes (July 14, 2025)**

**Overview**  
Resolved multiple TypeScript errors in the `video-uploader.tsx` component that were blocking the build. The fixes ensure type safety and correct JSX structure.

**Key Improvements:**  
- Replaced `ReactPlayer` with HTML5 video element to eliminate type errors  
- Fixed JSX structure by adding proper closing tags  
- Added video URL cleanup effect  
- Removed unused imports and refactored code  

**Next Steps:**  
- Continue with implementation of the core AI services.
