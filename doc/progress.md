*Update this file after each significant implementation or milestone.*

**Phase 1.3: Frontend Scaffolding (In Progress)**

*   **[DONE]** Created a product landing page (`src/app/page.tsx`).
*   **[DONE]** Designed and built a card-like UI for the `VideoUploader` component (`src/components/VideoUploader.tsx`).
*   **[DONE]** Implemented client-side file handling logic for the `VideoUploader` component, including drag-and-drop and file browsing.
*   **[DONE]** Installed and configured Zustand for UI state management (`src/store/ui.ts`).

# Progress Log

## [Current Step]
- Minimalist, distraction-free UI for video upload is complete.
- Users can upload videos up to 10 minutes (1GB) directly to Supabase Storage (raw_videos bucket).
- After upload, a video preview with curved edges is shown in the card.
- Two action buttons (❌ Cancel, ✔️ Proceed) appear at the bottom right after upload.
- UI/UX is clean, modern, and focused as per requirements.

### [2024-06-10] VideoUploader Refactor
- Refactored `VideoUploader` to use `react-dropzone` for drag & drop uploads, working directly with Supabase Storage API.
- Integrated `react-player` for clean video preview with built-in progress bar.
- Upload progress bar is now accurate and visually integrated into the minimalist card UI.
- Linter/type issues with `react-player` resolved by adding a local type declaration.
- Deferred resumable uploads for now; current implementation is robust for standard uploads.

### [2024-06-11] Supabase Security & API Refactor
- Removed hardcoded Supabase credentials from all client-side code.
- Refactored `VideoUploader` to upload videos via a secure Next.js API route (`/api/upload`).
- Supabase credentials are now loaded from environment variables on the server only.
- Added server-side logic to handle uploads and return public URLs securely.
- Provided SQL and guidance for enabling Row Level Security (RLS) on the `storage.objects` table in Supabase, restricting uploads and reads to authenticated users only.
- Next step: Apply RLS policies directly in the Supabase dashboard due to permission limitations in automated migrations.

## [Date: YYYY-MM-DD] Video Upload Refactor Complete
- Switched video upload to use Supabase signed URLs for direct-to-storage uploads.
- Created new API route at `src/app/api/upload-url/route.ts` for generating signed upload URLs.
- Updated `VideoUploader.tsx` to use the new signed URL flow (request, upload, log public URL).
- Deleted old upload API route and logic.
- Removed `bodySizeLimit` config from `next.config.ts` as large payloads are no longer sent to the server.
- Now supports large video uploads without 'Payload Too Large' errors.

## [Next Step]
- Implement resumable uploads with a real progress bar for large files (using tus-js-client or Uppy with Supabase's resumable upload endpoint).
- Integrate the resumable upload library into the VideoUploader component.
- Ensure upload progress is accurate and robust for large files and unstable networks.
- Maintain the same minimalist, beautiful UI/UX.
