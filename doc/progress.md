# Progress Log

## [Current Step]
- Minimalist, distraction-free UI for video upload is complete.
- Users can upload videos up to 10 minutes (1GB) directly to Supabase Storage (raw_videos bucket).
- After upload, a video preview with curved edges is shown in the card.
- Two action buttons (❌ Cancel, ✔️ Proceed) appear at the bottom right after upload.
- UI/UX is clean, modern, and focused as per requirements.

### [2024-06-10] VideoUploader Refactor
- Refactored `VideoUploader` to use `react-dropzone` for drag & drop uploads, working directly with Supabase Storage API.
- Integrated `react-player` for clean video preview with built-in progress bar.
- Upload progress bar is now accurate and visually integrated into the minimalist card UI.
- Linter/type issues with `react-player` resolved by adding a local type declaration.
- Deferred resumable uploads for now; current implementation is robust for standard uploads.

## [Next Step]
- Implement resumable uploads with a real progress bar for large files (using tus-js-client or Uppy with Supabase's resumable upload endpoint).
- Integrate the resumable upload library into the VideoUploader component.
- Ensure upload progress is accurate and robust for large files and unstable networks.
- Maintain the same minimalist, beautiful UI/UX.
