# Project Progress Log

## [Init] Project Setup & Planning
- Created implementation plan in `doc/implementation_plan.md`.
- Defined all major phases and tasks for IntelliSFX.

## [Frontend/Backend] Unified Setup
- Deleted the separate `frontend/` directory (standalone Next.js app).
- Adopted the Appwrite Starter Kit for Next.js in `backend/starter-for-nextjs/` as the unified codebase for frontend and backend integration.
- Using Appwrite Cloud for backend services and authentication.

## [Backend] Appwrite Setup
- Created `backend/` directory for Appwrite backend.
- Attempted to run Appwrite Docker container (user will complete Docker/Appwrite installation manually).

---

**Next:**
- Authentication setup (`/auth/login`, `/auth/register`) will be deferred to a later stage.
- Now starting on Phase 1.3 (Frontend Scaffolding) except authentication:
  - Build the dashboard (`/`) with project grid, upload CTA, and status indicators.
  - Create the drag-and-drop `VideoUploader` component.
  - Set up Zustand stores for `auth`, `projects`, and `ui` state.
